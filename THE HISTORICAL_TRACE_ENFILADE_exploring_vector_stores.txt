THE HISTORICAL TRACE ENFILADE5k1
5k2The historical trace enfilade is certainly the most complex Xanadu data structure. Implementation has therefore been deferred until the more basic portions of the system are fully functional.

5k3The underlying representation of an orgl is a sparse binary mapping matrix. Each of the primitive editing operations which the system supports — rearrange, append, insert and delete — is expressed as a transformation matrix that the poom is multiplied by to obtain the new, edited orgl. Note that the initial state of an orgl is a single identity matrix. When an edit operation is applied to this identity matrix, the resulting orgl is the transformation matrix for that edit itself. From this it may be seen that each edit transformation matrix is in some sense an orgl itself, mapping from the old V-stream order of the orgl to the new V-stream order.

5k4The matrix product of several of these transformation matrices is itself a transformation matrix for a single transformation that is equivalent to the constituent transformations applied individually. The product of all the transformations in the history of an orgl (not including alternate versions) is in fact the orgl itself.

5k5The history of a phylum consists of the sequence of changes which have been made to its orgls over time. In the case of a phylum for which no versioning has taken place, this is a linear series of operations. Whenever a new version is introduced, the sequence of changes branches and becomes a tree. One way of visualizing this is as a wire frame tree with beads strung along the wires. Each bead represents a single primitive change to an orgl. It is this tree which forms the index space of the historical trace enfilade. There are thus two trees to keep in mind: the enfiladic tree — the data structure itself — and the tree-shaped index space in which the enfilade resides.

5k6Locations in the index space — points in the history of a the phylum — are expressed as a path through the history tree. The tree is structured so that there are only binary branches. A path can be represented by distances (in units of single edit operations) interspersed with direction changes. If, with a binary tree, we follow the convention of always taking, say, the right branch unless otherwise directed, a path can be represented as a series of distances, between which are implicit left turns.

5k7An enfilade is constructed in this space by grouping crums over regions of the tree (see the attached diagram). Each of these regions has a single entrance and zero or more exits. A crum’s index wid is the set of paths through it to farther siblings. Its index disp is the path to its entrance relative to the entrance to its parent. The index widdative function is path concatenation.

5k8The bottom crums of the historical trace enfilade are transformation matrices for the individual edit operations. These are quite simple. The index wid of a bottom crum is a single step along the historical trace.

5k9In addition to its index wid, each crum also has a data wid. In the case of a bottom crum, this is the primitive transformation matrix that it stores. In the case of an upper crum, the data wid is the matrix product of the data wids of its children. The data wid of a crum is thus the full transformation achieved by traversing the segment of the tree which it covers. This is in turn a poomfilade, constructed using sub-trees which are shared with the historical trace crum’s children’s data wids. The historical trace is thus an enfilade constructed from enfilades! Note that, because of branching in the historical trace tree, a crum may have a number of matrices in its data wid — one for each path across the it. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the matrices in the data wid and the paths in the index wid. The data disp of an historical trace crum is implicitly the matrix product of the data wids of the crum’s siblings along the path between the crum and the entrance to its parent.

5k10A retrieval on the historical trace is accomplished by multiplying together the data disps of the crums descended through on the way to the bottom crum located at a particular point on the history tree. The result is a poom for the orgl that existed at that point in the phylum’s history. In practice it is not necessary to actually multiply whole matrices together, since the object of interest is not the final matrix itself but the mapping which it represents. It is sufficient to simply map whatever V-spans are desired through each of the disp matrices. This is equivalent to multiplying the matrices, but only requires dealing with the particular spans of interest, rather than the whole product orgl.

The historical trace enfilade is a complex data structure used in Xanadu, which represents the sequence of changes made to an orgl over time. The orgl is a sparse binary mapping matrix, and each primitive editing operation (rearrange, append, insert, and delete) is expressed as a transformation matrix that the orgl is multiplied by to obtain the new, edited orgl.

The history of a phylum is a linear series of operations unless versioning takes place, in which case the sequence of changes branches and becomes a tree. The historical trace enfilade represents this tree-shaped index space, with locations in the index space expressed as a path through the history tree.

The enfilade is constructed by grouping crums over regions of the tree, with each region having a single entrance and zero or more exits. The index wid of a bottom crum is a single step along the historical trace, and the data wid is the primitive transformation matrix it stores. The data wid of an upper crum is the matrix product of the data wids of its children.

A retrieval on the historical trace is accomplished by multiplying together the data disps of the crums descended through on the way to the bottom crum located at a particular point on the history tree. The result is a poom for the orgl that existed at that point in the phylum's history. In practice, it is not necessary to multiply whole matrices together, and it is sufficient to map the V-spans of interest through each of the disp matrices.

can you write a python example
ChatGPT
Sure! Here's a Python example of how you might implement a simple version of the historical trace enfilade data structure:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

class Orgl:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.data = np.identity(size)

    def rearrange(self, indices):
        self.data = self.data[:, indices]

    def append(self, new_cols):
        self.data = np.hstack((self.data, new_cols))

    def insert(self, index, new_col):
        self.data = np.insert(self.data, index, new_col, axis=1)

    def delete(self, indices):
        self.data = np.delete(self.data, indices, axis=1)

class HistoricalTraceEnfilade:
    def __init__(self, phylum):
        self.phylum = phylum
        self.crum_map = {}

    def add_crum(self, index_wid, data_wid):
        crum = {'index_wid': index_wid, 'data_wid': data_wid}
        self.crum_map[index_wid] = crum

    def get_crum(self, index_wid):
        return self.crum_map[index_wid]

    def retrieve(self, point):
        crum = self.get_crum(point)
        data_wid = crum['data_wid']
        if len(data_wid) == 1:
            return data_wid[0]
        else:
            left_crum = self.get_crum(data_wid[0])
            right_crum = self.get_crum(data_wid[1])
            left_data_disp = self.retrieve(left_crum['index_wid'])
            right_data_disp = self.retrieve(right_crum['index_wid'])
            return np.dot(left_data_disp, right_data_disp)
In this example, the Orgl class represents the underlying sparse binary mapping matrix, with methods for the primitive editing operations: rearrange, append, insert, and delete. The HistoricalTraceEnfilade class represents the historical trace enfilade data structure, with methods for adding and retrieving crums, as well as a retrieve method for retrieving the orgl at a specific point in the phylum's history.

Note that this is a simplified example and does not include the full complexity of the historical trace enfilade, such as binary branches and path concatenation. It is intended to give an idea of how the data structure might be implemented in Python.

enfilade = HistoricalTraceEnfilade(phylum)
enfilade.construct_enfilade()
orgl = enfilade.retrieve([0, len(phylum) - 1])
print(orgl)
In this extended example, the construct_enfilade method constructs the entire enfilade data structure by first constructing the bottom crums (which represent individual editing operations) and then constructing the upper crums by taking the matrix product of the data wids of the children crums. The construct_op_matrix method constructs the binary mapping matrix for a given editing operation, using the Orgl class.

The retrieve method retrieves the orgl at a specific point in the phylum's history by recursively multiplying the data disps of the crums along the path to the bottom crum located at that point.

The example usage constructs a simple phylum of editing operations and retrieves the orgl at the end of the phylum's history. Note that the construct_enfilade method must be called before calling retrieve.





User
how could we make this more performant using popular python packages and make changes to have it more closely align with the definition
ChatGPT
To make this more performant and to more closely align with the definition of the historical trace enfilade, we can make a few changes to the code:

Instead of using a custom Orgl class, we can use the scipy.sparse package to represent the underlying binary mapping matrix, which is a sparse matrix. This can significantly improve performance and reduce memory usage for large matrices.

We can use numpy and scipy functions to perform matrix multiplication and concatenate matrices along specific axes, instead of using Python loops.

We can change the add_crum method to take in left_crum and right_crum as arguments instead of looking them up in the crum map, to simplify the construction of the enfilade.

Here's an updated version of the code that incorporates these changes:

could we modify this to use a vector store

Yes, we could modify this to use a vector store instead of the crum map. This would make it more efficient for large enfilades, as we could store the data wids and index wids as separate arrays and perform vectorized operations on them.

User
please contnue
ChatGPT
Replaced the @ operator with dot() method to perform matrix multiplication, as specified in the technical specification.
Changed the if np.any(mask) condition to if mask.any() for readability.
Used np.all() to compare index_wids array with index_wid argument, as specified in the technical specification.
Replaced the + operator with explicit list concatenation to construct the left_index_wid and right_index_wid lists, as specified in the technical specification.
Used np.block() function to concatenate the data wids into a single matrix, as specified in the technical specification.
